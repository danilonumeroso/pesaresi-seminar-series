## About

This is a series of seminars organized, ideated and attended by PhD Students in Computer Science (and possibly faculty members) at UniPI.
This seminar series will consist (ideally) of 16+ seminars where students can discuss open problems in CS, present their recent results and
create connections and opportunities for collaborations among them and faculty members. 

If you're interested in giving a seminar, you can reach out to me at *danilo [dot] numeroso [at] phd [dot] unipi [dot] it* or to Laura Bussi
