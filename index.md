## About

This is a series of seminars organized, ideated and attended by PhD Students in Computer Science (and possibly faculty members) at UniPI.
This seminar series will consist (ideally) of 16+ seminars where students can discuss open problems in CS, present their recent results and
create connections and opportunities for collaborations among them and faculty members. 

**Important:** in order to get the credits, students need to attend at least 80% of the seminars as well as give one of them.
