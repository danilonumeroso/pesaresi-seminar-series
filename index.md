## About

This is a series of seminars organized, ideated and attended by PhD Students in Computer Science (and possibly faculty members) at UniPI.
This seminar series will consist (ideally) of 16+ seminars where students can discuss open problems in CS, present their recent results and
create connections and opportunities for collaborations among them and faculty members. 

If you're interested in giving a seminar, you can reach out to me at *danilo [dot] numeroso [at] phd [dot] unipi [dot] it* or to Laura Bussi

| Combinatorial properties of degree sequences of 3-uniform hypergraphs arising from saind arrays 	|  Giulia Palma	|  **15/01/2021** | The characterization of *k*-uniform hypergraphs by their degree sequences, say *k*-sequences, has been a longstanding open problem for *k>2*. Very recently its decision version was proved to be NP-complete by Deza et al. Formally, the decision version of the problem is: Given *π=(d<sub>1</sub>,d<sub>2</sub>,...,d<sub>n</sub>)* a non increasing sequence of positive integers, is *π* the degree sequence of a *k*-uniform simple hypergraph? The *NP*-completeness reduction uses, in an intermediate step, a subclass of 3-uniform hypergraphs whose incidence matrices are computed starting from a sequence of integer numbers. In general, the complexity of the reconstruction of the elements of such a subclass is unknown. <br> In this talk, we consider saind arrays *S<sub>n</sub>* of length *n*, i.e. arrays whose entries are the integers from *n* to *2-2n* in decreasing order, and we compute the related 3-uniform hypergraphs incidence matrices *M<sub>n</sub>*. The arrays of vertical projections, *V_n* of each *M<sub>n</sub>* turns out to be its degree sequences. We show that, for a generic *n ≥ 2*, *V<sub>n</sub>* and *V<sub>n+1</sub>* share the same entries starting from an index on. Furthermore, increasing *n*, these common entries converge to the integer sequence *A002620* in The Online Encyclopaedia of Integer Sequences. <br> This sequence is known to enumerate several combinatorial structures such as symmetric Dyck paths with three peaks, some families of integers partitions in two parts, bracelets with beads in three colours satisfying certain constraints and special kind of genotype frequency vectors. <br> We define bijections between the *V<sub>n</sub>* arrays and the above mentioned combinatorial families, thus showing an innovative approach to the study of 3-sequences which should provide subclasses of 3-uniform hypergraphs polynomially reconstructable. |

## FAQ
- **How long do the seminars last?**
Seminars will be 1-hour long. Speakers are warmly invited to conclude their presentations in 40-45 minutes, in order to leave
enough time for questions and discussions.

- **How can I get credits for this seminar series?**
In order to get credits, students need to attend at least 80% of the seminars as well as give one of them.

- **I am a 2+ year PhD student in CS, can I give a seminar?**
Yes, you can.
